# Netlify Sapper Template

This is the [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) Webpack template modified to support [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) out of the box.

In contrast to the original template, blog posts are saved as markdown files in `content/blog`y. To edit these files through Netlify CMS, enabled the `Identity` and `git-gateway` on your Netlify dashboard. Then you can log in at `/admin` and start editing the files.
