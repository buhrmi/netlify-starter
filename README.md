# Netlify Sapper Template

This is the [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) Webpack template modified to support [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) out of the box.

In contrast to the original template, blog posts are written in markdown and are being loaded from the `content/blog` directory.
